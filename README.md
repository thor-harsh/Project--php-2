**In this project we'll be using php to perform CRUD Operations.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is php and What do we actually understand by CRUD Operation**...<br></br>

**What is php?** <br></br>

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.
The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.<br></br>


**What is a CRUD?** <br></br>

CRUD is an acronym for the four basic operations used to create, read, update, and delete data in computer programming: <br>
1. Create: Create new records <br>
2. Read: Access existing records, either by searching or viewing them <br>
3. Update: Modify existing records <br>
4. Delete: Remove records from the database<br></br>


**Important Note: Before Jumping to the code please understand php and how it works by going to php manual here(https://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php)**
